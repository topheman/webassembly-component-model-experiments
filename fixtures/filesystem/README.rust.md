# filesystem

This directory was mounted with the `--dir tmp/filesystem` argument, giving only access to the `tmp/filesystem` directory.

The `tmp/filesystem` directory is a copy of the `fixtures/filesystem` directory.

You can safely modify the `tmp/filesystem` directory in your tests.

The rest of the files are mock files.
