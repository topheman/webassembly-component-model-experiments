# WebAssembly Component Model Experiments

> The WebAssembly Component Model is a broad-reaching architecture for building interoperable WebAssembly libraries, applications, and environments.

It is still very early days, but it is a very promising technology. However, the examples out there are either too simple or too complex.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of the WebAssembly Component Model, with more than a simple hello world.

It is a basic REPL, with a plugin system where:

- plugins can be written in any language compiling to WebAssembly
- plugins are sandboxed by default
- the REPL logic is written in Rust, it also compiles to WebAssembly (you could swap it for your implementation in your own language)

There are two kinds of hosts:

- a CLI host, written in Rust running in a terminal
- a web host, written in TypeScript running in a browser

Those hosts then run the same codebase which is compiled to WebAssembly:

- the REPL logic
- the plugins

## Usage

### cli-host (rust)

#### Install

```bash
# Install the cli-host binary - todo: make it available on crates.io
cargo install --git https://github.com/topheman/webassembly-component-model-experiments.git --branch main cli-host
```

#### Run

```bash
./target/debug/cli-host\
  --plugins https://topheman.github.io/webassembly-component-model-experiments/plugins/plugin_greet.wasm\
  --plugins https://topheman.github.io/webassembly-component-model-experiments/plugins/plugin_ls.wasm\
  --plugins https://topheman.github.io/webassembly-component-model-experiments/plugins/plugin_echo.wasm\
  --plugins https://topheman.github.io/webassembly-component-model-experiments/plugins/plugin_weather.wasm
```

Other flags:

- `--dir`: directory to be preopened (by default, the current directory)
- `--help`: displays manual
- `--repl-logic`: path or URL to WebAssembly REPL logic file (if not provided, the one included in the binary will be used)
- `--debug`: run the host in debug mode (by default, the host runs in release mode)

### web-host (typescript)

Go check [topheman.github.io/webassembly-component-model-experiments](https://topheman.github.io/webassembly-component-model-experiments) online demo.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.87+
- Node.js 22.6.0+ (needs `--experimental-strip-types` flag)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

### Setup

```bash
# Add WebAssembly targets
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown wasm32-wasip1
```

```bash
npm install
```

### cli-host (rust)

#### Build

```bash
just build
```

This will (see [justfile](./justfile)):

- compile the cli-host crate from rust to a binary file
- compile the repl-logic-guest crate from rust to wasm
- compile the plugin-* crates from rust to wasm

#### Run

```bash
./target/debug/cli-host\
  --plugins ./target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/plugin_greet.wasm\
  --plugins ./target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/plugin_ls.wasm\
  --plugins ./target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/plugin_echo.wasm\
  --plugins ./target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/plugin_weather.wasm
```

This will run the `cli-host` binary which will itself:

- load and compile the `repl_logic_guest.wasm` file inside the embedded `wasmtime` engine injecting the [`host-api`](./wit/host-api.wit) interface
- load and compile the `plugin_*.wasm` files into the engine, injecting the [`plugin-api`](./wit/plugin-api.wit) interface
- launch the REPL loop executing the code from the `repl_logic_guest.wasm` file which will:
  - readline from the user
  - parse the command
  - dispatch the command to the plugin(s) if needed (run the `run`, `man` functions of the plugins via the [`host-api`](./wit/host-api.wit) interface)
  - display the result

Other example:

```bash
./target/debug/cli-host\
  --plugins ./target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/plugin_ls.wasm\
  --plugins ./target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/plugin_echo.wasm\
  --dir /tmp
```

#### Test

```bash
# Runs unit tests and e2e tests on the REPL
just test
```

#### Make a rust plugin

```bash
cargo component new --lib crates/plugin-hello
```

### web-host (typescript)

#### Dev

```bash
npm run web-host:dev
```

This Will (see [packages/web-host/package.json](./packages/web-host/package.json)):

- generate types from the [wit](./wit) files using the [jco](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco) tool
- build the plugins from rust to wasm (so that you don't have to do it manually)
- build the repl-logic-guest from rust to wasm (so that you don't have to do it manually)
- copy the wasm files in `target/wasm32-wasip1/release` to the `packages/web-host/public/plugins` directory (to make them available via http for the `cli-host`)
- transpile the wasm files to javascript using the [jco](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco) tool into `packages/web-host/src/wasm/generated/*/transpiled` (this is the glue code wrapping the wasm files which is needed to interact with in the browser or node)
- start the vite dev server

Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see the web host.

#### Build

```bash
npm run web-host:build
```

Will do the same as the dev command, small changes:

- the build tasks called on the rust side are `just *-release` (release mode)
- it doesn't start the vite dev server, it builds the static files in the `dist` directory

You can then run `npm run web-host:preview` to preview the build.

## Developer experience

### Formating and linting

- I use [biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for formating and linting the TypeScript code
- I use cargo fmt for formating the rust code
- They are both configured to run on save in the editor

### Git hooks

- I use [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) to run lint-staged on pre-commit
- I use [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to run linting and formating on the changed files - the following are automatically run on pre-commit:
  - formating / linting the TypeScript code
  - formating the rust code
  - typechecking the TypeScript code
